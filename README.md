# Xylophone

## My Goal

My goal was to dive into a simple IOS recipe, how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. 

## What I created

I made my first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. 

## What I learned

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
